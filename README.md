# Halvorsen chaotic attractor
Python code in order to illustrate and animate the Halvorsen chaotic attractor which is described by the following system of 3 non-linear differential equations:


$\dot{x}=-ax-4y-4z-y^2$

$\dot{y}=-ay-4z-4x-z^2$

$\dot{z}=-az-4x-4y-x^2$

where:

 $\dot{x},\dot{y},\dot{z}=\frac{d x}{dt},\frac{d y}{dt},\frac{d z}{dt}$
